# Executive Summary

Football is arguably the most famous sport with a global following of approximately 3.5 to 4 billion fans, and has the highest television audience in sports worldwide. Some of the most well-known athletes to ever play the game are Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, huge household namesin Football. They are fan-favorites not because they play the game but also because they play it really well. Sports, including football, has now evolved to more than being an entertainment spectacle. Fans and enthusiasts are immersed into all facets of the game, including intricate game details and player statistics. This is where the game of Fantasy Sports comes in. Individuals compete based on the actual performance of players in sports. Player performance is determined by individual statistics which are converted to points then tallied by season-end. Websites such as the English Premier League website and FBREF.com contain rich data on football player statistics and Fantasy football.

In this project, our group analyzed various player and game statistics from FBREF.com and the English Premier League website. Data was extracted using manual webscraping and an API. The group stored the data in a database and matched player data from FBREF.com and the EPL website to come up with a main table containing player stats and their equivalent year-end Fantasy football points. We used Principal Component Analysis to determine the correlation between features and how they relate to fantasy points. Results show that attacker or offense-related statistics and goalkeeper statistics contribute the most in determining footballer players' total fantasy points. This is seen in our visualization of the top players segregated by statistics, our PCA analysis, and several machine learning models featured in this report. The findings in this report can be used by football fans and sports fans in general who are into Football and Fantasy Sports.

This paper features data that spans only players and statistics in the 2020-2021 season of the English Premier League. We recommend future researchers to expand the scope of player statistics and go beyond the last football season. We also suggest to delve into more comprehensive techniques such as other machine learning models so as to cover more ground in their analyses and investigation. Finally, we recommend possibly exploring other websites and other football leagues for better comparison and conclusions.
